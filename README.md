Focus Force Field: Keyboard Navigation Made Visible
The Problem: Many websites hide the "focus indicator" (the outline around buttons and links) for aesthetic reasons. For keyboard-only users or those with visual impairments, this makes the web impossible to navigate.

The Solution: Focus Force Field gives control back to the user. This extension aggressively enforces a high-visibility, high-contrast focus ring on every interactive element on every website you visit.

Key Features:

Guaranteed Visibility: Overrides "outline: none" and other CSS tricks that hide focus.

Fully Customizable: Use the built-in color picker to choose a color that works for your specific vision needs.

High Contrast: Uses a "stacked" outline design (a bright color paired with a dark shadow) to ensure visibility against both light and dark backgrounds.

Instant Updates: Change your preferred color in the popup and see it applied immediately without refreshing your tabs.
